  <h2>Complementary Challenge Ignite React Track</h2>
  <p align="left">Complementary challenge proposed in the React track of Rocketseat's Ignite. In this challenge, we were asked to apply what we learned about creating Hooks, using a FakeAPI with JSON Server.</p>
  <p align="left">It was not possible to deploy this project due to the need to use the FakeAPI with JSON Server.</p>

## Proposed Activities

- [x] Create a Hook and Apply its functioning logic.
- [x] Refactor the information inside App.tsx to their respective components.

## Extras

- [x] Fake API with JSON Server

<h3>Main Screen</h3>
<p align="left">The application consists of only one screen, divided into Content and SideBar. Clicking on the buttons in the SideBar will return information consistent with the clicked theme button. TypeScript was used to create communication between these two components, ensuring data passing follows a certain pattern, thus preventing the passing of invalid information.</p>
